Insect Classification and Alert System Using CNN

The Insect Classification and Alert System is a deep learning-based project designed to classify insects as harmful
or beneficial using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The system captures real-time images, processes them,
and generates alerts for harmful insects via SMS , enabling prompt action. It features a user-friendly dashboard for
monitoring and logging results and can be deployed in agricultural fields or research environments for effective pest
management and ecological monitoring.
